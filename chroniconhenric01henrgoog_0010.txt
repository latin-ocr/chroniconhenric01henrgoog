PREFAOE. Ι

Tan short Cnaon1onn,puhlishedfor the first time in

this volume, is found in a manuscript preserved in the

Ἰ British Museum [doemone Cleopatra,A⁹ xm]‚ and bears the

name of Ham on Smonavn as ita author. Nothing
more is known of him3 but we may safely pronounce

him to have been one of those numerous monks, who

employed themselves, during the middle ages, in histo-
rical and other litermy pursuits. It is probable that he
is the same person who is mentioned hy Emis os Tmen-
monam in his Annals (p. 45), as having been abhat of
ansay‚ and who died in 1268 ; in this case the latter
part of the Chroniole, which extends to 1274, must have
been added by another hand.

The sunname of Silgrave was, no doubt, taken hom

the place of his birth, which was perhaps Sulgrave in
ἱ Northamptonshire3 at least I can find no other place
