The Exonnrns nx msronnt Anononun [H] occurs in a

ι MS. given by the late Mt Donoe to the Bodleian librarys

[Donoe no 287, fot. 103] and written about the year 1200.
This little tract fumishes nnioe synopsis of many events
snd curiosities in early English History. The H. affixed to
the title is supposed to denote Henry ol Huntingdon, well
known to the student of English History. There is not

much to be gleaned from it; nor, on the other hand, is it

necessary to make an spology lor inserting so short a tract,

sor it only occupies a few peges which would otherwise have
been blank.
